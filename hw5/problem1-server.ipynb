      "###Write an XML-RPC server/client program pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The server offers 3 methods providing lossless image manipulation (be creative). Each server method must have descriptive documentation accessible by the client.\n",
      "- The client calls each method on the server machine with an array from an image.\n",
      "- Client saves the original image and modified image received from the server. Server saves image received from the client and modified image.\n",
      "- Include example images in your solutions, and test by running this through your local loopback ip address. If you\u2019d like to test from a remote computer, come to office hours on Monday and we will be set up to test your program over the network.\n",
      "- localhost ip = 127.0.0.1\n",
      "- http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplexmlrpcserver.html\n",
      "\n",
      "###Hints\n",
      "\n",
      "- Be creative with the server methods, but make sure the operations can be explained simply in English.\n",
      "- An example might be to switch color channels and reverse the order of the values in one channel.\n",
      "- Make sure to think about properly dealing with differently shaped image arrays (methods should be compatible with both 3-color and grayscale).\n",
      "- Lastly, XMLRPC won\u2019t transmit arrays, so you\u2019ll have to convert to another data structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- I implemented a class to run image manipulation effectively. The server itself runs independently but starts an instance of the class which allows me to create object attributes and methods to use between many functions for saving, change array type, etc.\n",
      "- You have to run both cells for the server to run continuously.\n",
      "- To kill the server: Keyboard Interrupt. This closes the server connection so you don't have to restart the entire kernel everytime."
