## Details of CalCalc Module:

###Inputs to Calculate function.
1) String input for evaluation.
2) Switch to force returning a float.
3) Switch to force usage of Wolfram Alpha

###General Release Notes:
1) Script result is hardcoded to only print output because returned output will not print to the command line.
2) Cannot evaluate strings with underscores "_" because this could be unsafe and allow calls to global variables.
3) Eval call does not have any global variables passed to it.
